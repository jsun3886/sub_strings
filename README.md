# sub_strings
This function will take the phrase in form of a string and a dictionary array.
It will lowercase all the letters in the phrase. Then, go through the dictionary 
counting the number of times each word appears in the string as a substring.
The result will be a hash with the word as the key and the number of times it
occurs as the value.
